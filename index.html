            <div class="love-story-container">
                <div class="love-story-text">
                    <p>We met on Tinder, like all great modern love stories do. We talked for a bit, then life happened, and by the summer of 2025 we had completely stopped talking. I assumed that chapter was closed until one random day I watched her Snapchat story. It was a video of her shotgunning a Twisted Tea with Bree, which honestly should have been my first clue that something special was about to re enter my life.</p>

                    <p>Moments later, my phone buzzed. A text from her. I was deeply confused. We had not spoken in months. Why now? I opened it and was immediately greeted with <strong>"HEYYY QUEEEN."</strong> And just like that, I was pulled right back in.</p>

                    <p>From that moment on, we started talking again more and more each day. I tried way too hard to impress her, mostly because I had never met anyone as beautiful as her and my brain stopped working accordingly. But it was not just her looks. She was kind in a way that felt genuine and effortless. She was generous, sweet, intelligent, and thoughtful. Being around her felt warm, like you were safe without even realizing why. And she always smelled like vanilla, which somehow made everything feel softer and more comforting.</p>

                    <p>We planned a few bowling dates because she talked a lot about beating me, and frankly, I was not about to let that kind of slander slide.</p>

                    <p>The only problem? Neither of us confirmed the dates. Not once. Not twice. Just mutual silence...</p>

                    <p>Eventually, I asked her out to the aquarium, a place I had never been before, but she suggested it. This time, I made sure the date was confirmed the day off(obviously I had to be the one to ask). We met up around 4 PM, well technically I arrived a little late, obviously. And I still remember the first moment I saw her.</p>

                    <p>She was wearing a brown sweater, jeans, Converse, and her hair was still recovering from dye, a beautiful mix of greens and pinks. She was absolutely stunning. I was instantly nervous. My mind went blank. I had no idea what to say. Somehow, by pure miracle, I started making her laugh. And suddenly everything felt right. Talking to her felt natural and easy, like I had been doing it forever.</p>

                    <p>Then we went to get sushi. This is where I revealed my greatest flaw. I cannot use chopsticks. I stabbed the sushi like it owed me money and prayed she would not notice. She noticed.</p>

                    <p>After sushi we went back to the aquarium, we sat in her car, a 2020 Honda Civic. The interior was decorated with glowing skull lights that softly illuminated our faces while we talked. It felt intimate and calm, like the world had slowed down just for us. Her car was covered in stickers from her favorite show, including JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, and listening to her talk about the things she loved made me like her even more. She was smart, passionate, and so genuinely herself. Time completely disappeared. Before we knew it, it was late and I had to leave. I was way too nervous to even think about kissing her, so I did what any confident romantic would do. I extended my hand for a handshake. She pulled me in for a hug instead. Bless her.</p>

                    <p>Our first kiss did not happen until our second date. We were behind a Domino's near the Majestic Theater in Meridian, fueled by Dutch Bros. I had no idea how to initiate a kiss. Do I lean in? Ask? Panic and run? Not wanting to seem like a total dork, I had a sudden stroke of genius.</p>

                    <p>I asked her to dance.</p>

                    <p>She played <strong>"Let's Groove"</strong> in the background. I pulled her in close, and that is where we shared our first kiss. And just like that, something real began.</p>

                    <p>I did not officially ask her to be my girlfriend until our fifth date, which took place at my brother's apartment. I could not remember if she had told me she was vegan or vegetarian, so naturally, I assumed vegan and made her a vegan pizza. The cheese was, without exaggeration, the worst cheese I have ever made in my life. But somehow, she still said yes.</p>

                    <p>And that moment sparked the beginning of our relationship on <strong>November 27th, 2022</strong>.</p>

                    <p class="story-ending">Turns out, all it really took was a Snapchat story, bad chopstick skills, glowing skull lights, questionable vegan cheese, and one perfectly timed dance.</p>
